# Is It Done?
This project aims to provide a basic functionality of creating to do lists.

## Features
1. You can create and manage projects
1. You can create new entities from a list of entity types. By default there are no entity type values present, so an add entity button is presented. The entities are global, and once created can be used in any project.
1. You can add a type entity, like **video** and you can add and manage tasks to it. When you add an entity, the last one added remains selected so the next one created is easier to be done as mostly you don't change the type.
1. You can add Chapters and manage them. Chapters are dependant on the project they are created from.
1. Each new entity type value needs to be part of a chapter. When no chapters are present an **add chapter** button needs to be present.
1. The tasks have the behaviour of a boolean, meaning they can be toggled on or off. By default they are off.
1. The tasks can be added inside a project
